L0 coverage run result (latest)
==============================
Date: 2026-01-02
Script: app-gateway2/AppGateway/l0test/run_l0_coverage.sh
SDK prefix: /home/kavia/workspace/code-generation/dependencies/install
Log: app-gateway2/AppGateway/l0test/coverage/L0_COVERAGE_BUILD_AND_RUN.log

Result: FAILED (build did not complete; tests and coverage not generated)

Primary failure: Thunder SDK shim headers use unqualified `string`
 (expects WPEFramework::string), but core.h only defines WPEFramework::Core::string.
 Example: WPEFramework/plugins/IDispatcher.h and IShell.h.

Repro summary (before latest code change removing AddRef/Release from RespondJob):

- Rebuilt plugin:
  ./build_plugin_appgateway.sh
  Result: OK

- Ran L0 once via:
  ./tests/l0/appgateway/run_coverage.sh

- Observed:
  - L0 still ends with SIGSEGV (exit 139) and creates core dumps:
    core.40738, core.40604 (timestamp Jan 6 16:43)
  - gdb is not installed in this container, so backtrace was not captured.

Hypothesis:
- Remaining SIGSEGV likely tied to RespondJob AddRef/Release on AppGatewayImplementation (unsafe if object is not heap-owned in L0/in-proc),
  and/or jobs running after teardown without a hard "stop scheduling + drain" gate.

This summary file is informational and should be updated after the next CI run.

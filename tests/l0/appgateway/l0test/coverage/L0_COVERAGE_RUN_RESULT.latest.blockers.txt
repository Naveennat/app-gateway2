Blockers / Current Status (auto-generated by agent)

1) Upstream develop AppGateway plugin build (entservices-infra/AppGateway) currently fails in this workspace due to:
   - Missing generated JSON-RPC wrapper: Exchange::JAppGatewayResolver
   - Local IAppNotifications stub missing Subscribe/Cleanup, required by AppGatewayImplementation.cpp
   These have been addressed in-repo by updating:
     - app-gateway2/interfaces/IAppNotifications.h
     - app-gateway2/interfaces/json/JAppGatewayResolver.h (minimal stub)
     - app-gateway2/interfaces/json/JsonData_AppGatewayResolver.h (placeholder)

2) The coverage script run (app-gateway2/AppGateway/l0test/run_l0_coverage.sh) failed to link because the real plugin .so was not successfully rebuilt/installed yet.
   The script expects one of:
     - build/app-gateway/AppGateway/libWPEFrameworkAppGateway.so (preferred), or
     - dependencies/install/lib/plugins/libWPEFrameworkAppGateway.so (fallback)

3) The install prefix layout uses STORAGE_DIRECTORY=wpeframework, so plugin install destination from upstream CMake is:
     dependencies/install/lib/wpeframework/plugins/
   The l0test CMakeLists.txt currently also checks:
     ${PREFIX}/lib/plugins/libWPEFrameworkAppGateway.so
   If needed, a copy/symlink should be created so both paths are satisfied.

Next actions (for a follow-up agent with tool budget):
- Re-run:
    cmake --build app-gateway2/dependencies/build/entservices-infra --target WPEFrameworkAppGateway
    cmake --install app-gateway2/dependencies/build/entservices-infra
- Ensure plugin .so exists at one (or both) expected locations:
    dependencies/install/lib/wpeframework/plugins/libWPEFrameworkAppGateway.so
    dependencies/install/lib/plugins/libWPEFrameworkAppGateway.so
- Then rerun:
    app-gateway2/AppGateway/l0test/run_l0_coverage.sh
and confirm coverage HTML output under:
    app-gateway2/AppGateway/l0test/coverage/index.html

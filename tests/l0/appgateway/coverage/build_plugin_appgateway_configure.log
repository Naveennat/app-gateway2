CMake Error at /home/kavia/workspace/code-generation/app-gateway2/dependencies/install/lib/cmake/WPEFrameworkPlugins/WPEFrameworkPluginsConfig.cmake:22 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindConfigGenerator.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "ConfigGenerator", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "ConfigGenerator"
  with any of the following names:

    ConfigGeneratorConfig.cmake
    configgenerator-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "ConfigGenerator" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "ConfigGenerator_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.
  If "ConfigGenerator" provides a separate development package or SDK, be
  sure it has been installed.

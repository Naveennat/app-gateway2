# AppGateway L0 Coverage Artifacts

This directory is populated by:

- `tests/l0/appgateway/run_coverage.sh`

Expected outputs:
- `console.log` — full console output from the coverage run (configure/build/test/lcov/genhtml).
- `coverage.info` — lcov tracefile.
- `html/` — genhtml report (open `html/index.html`).
- `summary.txt` — human-readable coverage summary (if generated by wrapper/CI step).
- `blockers.txt` — blockers or failures captured by wrapper/CI step.

If `summary.txt` / `blockers.txt` are missing, generate them from `coverage.info` and `console.log` respectively in your CI wrapper step.

# AppGateway L0 Coverage Artifacts

This directory is populated by:

- `tests/l0/appgateway/run_coverage.sh`

Expected outputs (generated by `tests/l0/appgateway/run_coverage.sh`):
- `console_output.txt` — full console output from the coverage run (configure/build/test/lcov/genhtml).
- `coverage.info` — lcov tracefile.
- `html/` — genhtml report (open `html/index.html`).

Additional summaries (generated/updated by CI or wrapper step):
- `summary.txt` — human-readable coverage summary.
- `blockers.txt` — blockers/failures captured from console output.

Notes / verification points:
- The harness prefers linking/loading the installed plugin at:
  - `${PREFIX}/lib/wpeframework/plugins/libWPEFrameworkAppGateway.so` (preferred), or
  - `${PREFIX}/lib/plugins/libWPEFrameworkAppGateway.so` (compat).
- SDK headers/libraries are expected under `${PREFIX}/include` and `${PREFIX}/lib`
  where `PREFIX` defaults to `app-gateway2/dependencies/install`.

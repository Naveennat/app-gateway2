Date: 2026-01-05
Plugin used: dependencies/install/lib/plugins/libWPEFrameworkAppGateway.so
SDK used:   dependencies/install

Console output (captured):
- tests/l0/appgateway/coverage/console.latest.txt

Coverage artifacts:
- lcov tracefile: NOT GENERATED (script aborted during test execution)
- genhtml report: NOT GENERATED (script aborted during test execution)

Failure summary (from console.latest.txt):
- Runtime instantiation failure:
  - "Missing implementation classname AppGatewayImplementation in library"
  - Initialize() returns non-empty error: "Could not retrieve the AppGateway interface."
  - JSON-RPC resolve not registered/callable (dispatcher Invoke returned rc=53 in failing case)

- Prior abort root cause (now addressed via test-harness-only change):
  - Calling Initialize() twice on the same plugin instance triggered:
    ASSERT [plugin/AppGateway/AppGateway.cpp:65] (mResponder == nullptr)
  - Process terminates with exit code 134 (Aborted / core dumped)

Exit code observed in latest console.latest.txt: 134
